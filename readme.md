Semantic UI
===========

This is the main repository for the PRISM semantic UI.

It is composed of a react front-end, and python api which reads a triplestore.
The `k8s` directory contains a kubernetes configuration for deployment in production.
While the `prism_demo` and `sem_api` contain Dockerfiles and instructions for running locally.
